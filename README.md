# 🤖 Self-Balancing Robot

**A 4-person team project for [Your University/Class Name, e.g., ECE 480 Capstone].**

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and design files for our two-wheeled self-balancing robot. Our goal is to create a stable, responsive robot using a PID control system and sensor fusion.



###  STATUS: 🚧 In-Progress

We are currently working on [e.g., "tuning the PID controller" or "integrating the remote control"].

## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Stable Balancing:** Uses a PID controller to maintain balance on two wheels.
* **Sensor Fusion:** Combines accelerometer and gyroscope data using a [e.g., Complementary Filter / Kalman Filter] for an accurate orientation estimate.
* **[Your Feature]:** e.g., Bluetooth/Wi-Fi remote control via a mobile app.
* **[Your Feature]:** e.g., 3D printed chassis and custom PCB.
